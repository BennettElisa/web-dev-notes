## Back-End Development

The back-end of web development allows us to interact with databases or have business logic on the server.

The back-end consist of :

- Server
  - servers "serve" up your files such as your HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Database
  - can store your user data i.e
    - user login name
    - passwords
- Applications
  - creates the business logic and determine how your web applications work i.e
    - calculating flight prices
    - making payments etc.

**Great Analogy for Full-Stack Development** - Front of house restaurant (Client-Side) - what the user sees in the brower, interact with website etc. - Kitchen (Server) - this is where all the dishes get served from - the order gets sent to the server and sends back what the client wants. - Lader i.e food storage to make food (Database) - all the user data, event data etc. is stored

Back-End Technologies & Frameworks:

Think of **frameworks** that support these backend technologies/languages as the **bolierplate shortcuts** that you ❤️ using for your HTML docs. Boliterplates cut down on time that you would otherwise spend doing the same thing over and over again each time you want to create an HTML document. This is the POWER of a framework. Let's look at the Top 5 backend languages and the frameworks that support them in making developers more efficient.

- Node.js
  - Backend language
  - Framework **Express**:
    - speeds up development
    - helps to reduce the amont of repetitive things a developer does
    - cuts down some of the grunt work and saves a lot of time
  - Why Node.js?
    - often selected as the **BACKEND LANGUAGE** of choice when you already know **JavaScript**
    - fast and scalable
  - Companies that use Noje.js:
    - ebay
    - uber
    - twitter
    - netflix
- Java

  - Backend language
  - Framework **Spring**:

- PHP

  - Backend langugage
  - Framework **CakePHP**:

- Ruby

  - Backend languag
  - Framework **Ruby on Rails**

- Python
  - Backend language
  - Framework **Django**

Which technology are we going to choose to create our backend web applications? YOU GET TO CHOOSE!

With that being said, the class I'm in currently focuses on Node.js
so my notes moving foward will be focused on Node.js.

So, why do we want or need to use Node.js?

Up until now, as Angela explained, JavaScript has not been able to go outside the boundiares of the browser. However, there are some situations such as when you are building a desktop application when you need to be able to access the file sytem, listen to the network request etc.

There are various situations when you need to write code that interacts DIRECTLY with the computer independent of what is happening in the browser. **This is what Node.js allows us to do.**

It takes JavaScript OUT OF THE BROWSER therefore allowing it to interact DIRECTLY with the hardware of the computer. - ATOM (the code editor) is based on Node.js - Allows developers to build full applications that work outside of the browser and on computer - used to program desktop applications - also used to run node.js on servers

The fact that Node.js can run JavaScript on your computer or on someone elses computer i.e a SERVER is what makes this so powerful.

**Great Analogy**

A student opens up a Google Search Engine in the browser and types in a "query" i.e searches for the "Top 10 Educational Apps". The browser will make a request to the Google Servers and ON THE SERVERS we can execute JavaScript code to PROCESS the request. After this is complete we can send back the information to the user/client and get their web broswer to display the information.

All of this happens behind the scences on the SERVER SIDE with the help of Node.js.
